# Time_Series_Stationarity

This study empirically examines the theoretical critical values of the Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity of time series. These emprirical critical values are calculated for various time series lengths, and their convergence to theoretical ones is analyzed as the sample size increases.

The study consists of the following stages:

* Introduction and formulation of the research question
* Some insights from time series theory
* Justification and description of the Dickey-Fuller tests
* Simulating random walk processes for various sample sizes.
* For each sample size, empirical distributions of t-statistics are constructed, and their critical values are calculated.
* A graph is plotted to illustrate how the theoretical and empirically derived critical values of t-statistics depend on the length of the time series.
* The empirical and theoretical results from the previous steps are compared using the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) metric.

Conclusion:
The results are summarized, and an answer to the research question is provided.
